# The AirBnB Clone Project

This is AirBnB Project

## Project Description

This is a project that is part of the Holberton School curriculum. The purpose of this project is to build a clone of the AirBnB website. This is the first step towards building the full web application: the console. This first step is very important because it will be used for all the other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration.

Data (python objects) generated are stored in a json file and can be accessed with the help of the json module in python

## Description of the command interpreter:

The command interpreter is the program that receives and executes the commands the user writes. It is the core of the project, since it is the entry point to the rest of the functionality. This is a simple version of the UNIX shell, which is the program that reads and executes commands from a file or the terminal.
